# Winter Wonderland

"Winter Wonderland" is a simple and cozy winter scene created using the p5.js library. The project features a house, a branching tree, a moon, and falling snowflakes, all set against a dark background.

# Features
Animated snowflakes that fall from the top of the screen
A house with a roof, door, and windows
A branching tree with a dark brown trunk and green leaves
A moon in the night sky
Atmospheric effects like fog or haze to create a cozy, winter atmosphere

# Usage
To run the "Winter Wonderland" project, you'll need to have the p5.js library installed. You can either include the p5.js library from a CDN or download the library and include it in your project.

Once you have the p5.js library set up, you can copy the code from the provided sketch.js file and paste it into your project. Save the file and open it in a web browser to see the "Winter Wonderland" scene.

# Customization
You can customize the "Winter Wonderland" project by modifying the following aspects:

Colors: You can change the colors of the house, tree, moon, and other elements by updating the fill() function calls in the code.
Snowflake Properties: You can adjust the number of snowflakes, their size, and their speed by modifying the values in the snowflakes array and the drawSnow() function.
Tree Branching: You can experiment with the branching patterns of the tree by adjusting the angles and lengths in the drawBranch() function.
Atmospheric Effects: You can modify the fog or haze effect by changing the alpha value in the addAtmosphericEffects() function.
Feel free to explore and make the project your own!
